# Flight Price Predictor

## üß© Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices fluctuate frequently based on various factors, making it challenging for travelers to determine the best time and option to book. This project aims to develop a flight price predictor using machine learning to estimate the cost of a flight based on inputs like airline, journey date, duration, and stops. The goal is to provide users with a reliable estimate of ticket prices using historical flight data.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: The file can be found in Notebook\data\flight-price.xlsx
- **Shape**: `10682 rows √ó 11 columns`

### ‚úèÔ∏è Features:
1. **Airline** ‚Äì Name of the airline  
2. **Date_of_Journey** ‚Äì Date on which journey commenced  
3. **Source** ‚Äì City of origin  
4. **Destination** ‚Äì Final destination  
5. **Route** ‚Äì Path taken by the flight  
6. **Dep_Time** ‚Äì Departure time  
7. **Arrival_Time** ‚Äì Arrival time  
8. **Duration** ‚Äì Total time from takeoff to landing  
9. **Total_Stops** ‚Äì Number of stops  
10. **Additional_Info** ‚Äì Extra details such as meal availability or class type

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
1. The data contained only a few missing values and duplicate entries so these entries where dropped.
2. The Date_of_Journey column contained dates in DD/MM/YYYY format so string.split() function was used to separate the data into day_of_journey, month_of_journey and year_of_journey columns and saved in the table.
3. Dep_Time was present in HH:MM format so string.split() function was used, and the hours and minutes were saved in separate columns.
4. Arrival_Time also had a similar format as Dep_Time but in some records the dates were also present for e.g "10:25 13 Mar". Therefore string.split() function was first used to split the date and time and then the resulting string was split to obtain the arrival_hour and arrival_min and saved in respective columns.
5. For duration column pd.to_timedelta() function was used it gave the duration in seconds which was subsequently converted to duration in minutes and saved in Duration_mins column.
6. Total_Stops column contained 4 unique entries ['non-stop', '2 stops', '1 stop', '3 stops', '4 stops'] so a .map() was used to convert these to integers and stored in the same column.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Airline vs Price**  
   Bar chart showed average prices vary significantly by airline.  
   - *Jet Airways Business* was the most expensive  
   - *Trujet* was the least expensive  
   ![Airline](./assets/airline.png)

2. **Additional_Info vs Price**  
   Additional services and flight classes impacted ticket price.  
   ![Additional Info](./assets/additional.png)

3. **Total_Stops vs Price**  
   More stops generally correlated with higher prices.  
   ![Total Stops](./assets/total_stops.png)

4. **Correlation Analysis (Spearman)**  
   - `Total_Stops`: **0.7166**  
   - `Duration_mins`: **0.5767**  
   - Other time-based features showed low correlation

5. **Time Normalization**  
   - Created `Dep_time_sinceMidnight`, `Arrival_time_sinceMidnight`  
   - These features had slightly better correlation but still weak

## üîß Feature Engineering

1. Created `*_time_sinceMidnight` columns for normalized time features  
2. Used **Geopy** and **OpenStreetMap API** to compute distance between source and destination  
   - Fixed a typo in *Bangalore*  
   - Resulting `Distance (in km)` had a correlation of **0.3699** with price
